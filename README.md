# IPL-SCORE-PREDECTION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING-
This project uses a deep learning regression model to predict the final score of an ongoing IPL T20 match based on real-time inputs like teams, venue, current score, overs, wickets, and players. It includes data preprocessing, model training with Keras &amp; TensorFlow, evaluation, and an interactive prediction widget for live simulations.
